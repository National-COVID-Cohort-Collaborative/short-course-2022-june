========

A running list of the links that we introduce to the students that might be helpful references in the future.

Specific to N3C --public material
----------

* [N3C Enclave Description](https://covid.cd2h.org/): "The N3C Data Enclave is a secure platform through which the harmonized clinical data provided by our contributing members is stored. The data itself can only be accessed through a secure cloud portal hosted by NCATS and cannot be downloaded or removed."

* [N3C Domain Teams](https://covid.cd2h.org/domain-teams) "provide an opportunity to collect pilot data for grant submissions, train algorithms on larger datasets, inform clinical trial design, learn how to use tools for large scale COVID-19 data, and validate results"

* [NIH's N3C site](https://ncats.nih.gov/n3c)

Specific to N3C --requires access to the Enclave

* [Enclave Dashboard](https://unite.nih.gov/workspace/home/)

* [Object Explorer](https://unite.nih.gov/workspace/hubble/exploration/)

* [N3C Knowledge Store](https://unite.nih.gov/workspace/module/view/latest/ri.workshop.main.module.3ab34203-d7f3-482e-adbd-f4113bfd1a2b?id=KO-BE5C652)

* [N3C Training](https://unite.nih.gov/workspace/slate/documents/training) includes links to the
  * *Training portal*: organizes training modules in topics ranging from OMOP to analyses, including video tutorials, live events and archival recordings, and links to other helpful resources.
  * *Self Guided Tours*: The Academy feature (found under Help & Support in the lower-left navigation menu) provides interactive guided tours of this platform. The tutorial Foundry 101, Navigation is especially helpful to understand dataset access, organization, and social features.
  * *N3C Community Notes*: a tool to collect and manage lessons learned, frequently asked questions, notes, and institutional knowledge that have been accumulated by the N3C community in the course of doing their research. The topics covered by these notes are not limited, and cover subjects like Data Quality, Vaccine data, concept sets, and more.
  * *Documentation*: serves as a portal to many other resources for all levels of users. It contains a comprehensive catalog of guides, tutorials, and best practices in a variety of mediums, such as text and video.
  * *Support*: Having Trouble? Visit the support page for troubleshooting and contact information.

* [Introducing Macrovisits](https://unite.nih.gov/workspace/report/ri.report.main.report.c9e2ca50-860c-4988-93c6-f5b1d9d915ed): The goal of the macrovisit logic is to group all of these small visits together to create what the patient and physician might recognize as a single hospitalization

OMOP
-----------

OMOP describes the structure of the dataset of the N3C source tables

* [The Book of OHDSI](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/): OHDSI is the organizaion that created and maintains OMOP.  The "Common Data Model" chapter is especially relevant to beginning N3C users

* [OMOP Clinical Data Tables](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm60.html#Clinical_Data_Tables): a condensed specification of the tables and their columns

* [Athena](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms): an OHDSI tool that explores [concepts](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/CommonDataModel.html#representation-of-content-through-concepts).

* [Atlas](https://atlas-demo.ohdsi.org/): an OHDSI tool to provide a unified interface to patient level data and analytics

* [OHDSI Data standardization](https://ohdsi.org/data-standardization/): "the critical process of bringing data into a common format that allows for collaborative research, large-scale analytics, and sharing of sophisticated tools and methodologies."
