1. Ad-hoc Manual Inspections
2. Automated

The two strategies can be connected.  If a ad-hoc inspection is enlighting, consider spending ~15 minutes to make the report easily reproducible as things change.  Here are some reasons why the report should be be monitored repeatedly are changes in

* Temporal Trends(*e.g.*, the dataset from Jan 2020 to Dec 2020 looks different that from Jan 2020 to Dec 2022)
* Inclusion criteria (*e.g.*, you further restrict the list of diagnosis code)
* Data Parter sites (*e.g.*, a new site contributes data with patterns you did't anticipate)
